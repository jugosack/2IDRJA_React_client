          This is our first web programming project, it is a fully functional
          platform for booking apartments in Asprovalta.
          <br />
          <br />
          The website was built using React, Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS and creates a seamless,
          user-friendly experience. It features a responsive front end design to adapt to any
          screen size whether it is on mobile, tablet or desktop and a secure back end to
          protect sensitive user information.
          <br />
          <br />
          Visitors are able to create accounts, while signing up they will receive an e-mail
          to verify their e-mail address, then they can log in, search for available bookings
          based on specific dates and months.
          <br />
          <br />
          Weâ€™ve integrated a secure booking and payment system, allowing users to conveniently
          reserve and pay for their chosen apartments.
          <br />
          <br />
          This project reflects our commitment to delivering functional, real-world
          applications and demonstrates our growing expertise in web development.
          Our team has worked diligently to ensure the platform is user-centric, with
          features that simplify and enhance the booking experience.
